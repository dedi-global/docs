# The vision for Decentralised Directory (DeDi)

### <mark style="color:$info;background-color:$primary;">Decentralized Directory (DeDi): Enhancing Trust in Digital Transactions</mark>

#### The Problem: Slow, Expensive Verification. High-cost of establishing trust!

> DeDi solves costly verification problems. Businesses spend time and resources checking if documents, credentials, and data are valid. DeDi creates a universal way to verify public information instantly.&#x20;

Every day, people carry out millions of digital transactions, which underpin the global economy.&#x20;

Establishing trust by verifying the **integrity, validity, and authenticity** of documents, digital credentials, transactions, or data packets is paramount for seamless execution of these transaction&#x73;**. While integrity can often be verified through digital signatures, ensuring validity** <mark style="background-color:purple;">(is the information current, not revoked?)</mark> and **authenticity** <mark style="background-color:blue;">(is the source trustworthy?)</mark> **remains a significant challenge.** _(For details on Integrity, Validity, and Authenticity, refer to ‘Understanding Trust Pillars’ in Appendix)_

In our interconnected digital world, trust is established through public information maintained by custodians, registrars, and institutions of authority. These are often referred to as public directories – specialized electronic registries containing publicly available information about entities and things. Examples include directories of companies, banks, courts, language codes, location codes, directories of registered professionals (e.g., doctors, lawyers), a directory of government-authorized service providers, and more such directories. Historically, even "Yellow Pages" served as a form of public directory.

Currently, establishing this trust involves:

* **Inefficient Processes, leading to Higher Costs:** Organizations spend excessive time and resources manually searching for and verifying critical information. These outdated methods can slow down operations, increase labor costs, and introduce errors that damage reliability.
* **Risk of Bad Decisions due to Delayed or Outdated Information:**  When up-to-date information isn’t readily available, businesses may miss important updates (like revoked credentials), potentially making wrong decisions or exposing themselves to fraud and security risks.
* **Difficult Integrations result in Missed Opportunities and Slower Growth:** Inconsistent and custom-built interfaces make it hard for businesses to connect with multiple registries. This adds integration costs, delays time-to-market, and hinders innovation or expansion into new markets where interoperability is key.

DeDi overcomes these challenges by transforming fragmented and inefficient registries—whether manual or digital—into programmable, agent-ready directories. This empowers businesses with instant access to reliable information, streamlined processes, and seamless integration for the demands of the digital age. It provides a unified, machine-readable interface for accessing essential public information, fostering secure and efficient digital transactions.

#### Decentralized Directory Protocol – universal way to discover & verify public information

{% hint style="success" %}
**DeDi is  a project under** [**Linux Foundation Decentralised Trust (LFDT)**](https://www.lfdecentralizedtrust.org/) **as part of their**[ **LFDT labs** ](https://lf-decentralized-trust-labs.github.io/labs/lfdt/decentralized-directory-dedi.html)**initiatives.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

DeDi unlocks new business value by making public directories accessible through a universal protocol coupled with suggested practices.&#x20;

At its core, DeDi is an open protocol that defines universal, standardized API specifications for accessing any public registry, enabling seamless lookup and querying across diverse information sources. By providing open-source API specifications, DeDi eliminates the need for costly custom integrations, allowing registrars to implement a unified and consistent interface for public information access.&#x20;

DeDi doesn't necessitate changes to existing processes but implements characteristics that make public directories suitable for enhancing trust at a low cost such as:

* **Publicly Accessible:** Allows anyone to look up specific records or query for multiple records, promoting transparency and broad usability.
* **Machine-Readable:** Accessible over standard APIs (HTTPS, RESTful) with well-known schemas for easy programmatic interpretation and automation.
* **Tamper-Resistant:** Offers cryptographic guarantees to ensure the immutability and verifiability of records, enabling a "trust, but verify" approach.
* **Provenance-Enabled:** Provides authorship of entries and a history of changes, allowing access to earlier versions for transparency and auditability.
* **Live and Frequently Updated:** Ensures that information such as membership statuses, sanctions, and public keys is always up-to-date, reducing risks associated with outdated data.

> Important Note: The Decentralized Directory Protocol is not a software product or a rigid implementation manual—it is an open standard designed to enable trust in digital transactions by providing a universal, interoperable foundation for accessing and verifying public information.

## [dedi.global](https://dedi.global) – ready to use solution

To accelerate and simplify adoption,  [dedi.global](http://dedi.global), is offered by the [Network for Humanity Foundation](https://networksforhumanity.org/) as a ready to use, universal Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). This philanthropic initiative allows registrars to effortlessly publish and manage their directories on a robust decentralized infrastructure, leveraging blockchain for automated governance, scalability, and enhanced trust—complementing and fully aligned with the open DeDi protocol.

By adopting the DeDi Protocol, relying parties can maintain a list of trusted domains and seamlessly query and look up public information, verifying digital assets and identities with unprecedented ease and confidence.

DeDi supports the co-existence of multiple data standards and schemas (e.g., VC JSON-LD, mDocs/mDL) and can output information in various formats, ensuring compatibility with existing systems and technologies.
