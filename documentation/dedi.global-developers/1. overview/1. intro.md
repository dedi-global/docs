# Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to help users get started with **DeDi**.

The **DeDi Protocol** defines a universal, open standard for discovering and verifying public information across the internet. It specifies a machine-readable, unified API that enables interoperability and trust in querying and verifying public directories.

**DeDi Global** is a SaaS implementation of the DeDi (Decentralized Directories) Protocol.

Before proceeding, review the core protocol specifications available at [github.com/dedi-global](https://github.com/dedi-global) to gain a foundational understanding of the DeDi architecture and design principles.

Anyone implementing the DeDi Protocol or integrating with DeDi Global must be familiar with its **three-tier architecture** and **API conventions**, which together enable secure and verifiable data discoverability.
