# Use DeDi in your workflows

DeDi’s information architecture is organized around three key constructs:

* **Namespace:** Corresponds to an organization (and implicitly to a domain name) as a starting point for trust.
* **Directory:** Refers to a list of records with configurable schemas.
* **Records:** The actual values or pointers to information.
